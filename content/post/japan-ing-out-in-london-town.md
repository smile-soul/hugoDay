## Ramen Noodle Soup

[Ramen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen) is very popular in Japan and I am a big fan of it. I crave it especially after having a few drinks. I often wish Bristol had a decent ramen restaurant like there is in London.

My wife and I try to go to a different restaurant each time we visit London. This time we went for lunch at [Ippudo London](http://www.ippudo.co.uk/) in St. Giles. Ippudo is good both on flavour and in terms of customer service but it comes at a premium price.  It is true that you get what you pay for.  Nevertheless we would happily go back there again.  I felt nostalgic remembering the days when I used to queue up to eat at Ippudo in Tokyo, although I could not help but notice that in London a meal is about three times the price that you would expect back in Japan.

Whilst writing, there was another ramen restaurant called [Kanadaya](https://www.kanada-ya.com/home/) across the road from Ippudo in St Giles. There was a long queue at Kanadaya, which is a good sign. We will definitely give it a go next time.

## Japan Centre

Next stop on our trip was the [Japan Centre](https://www.japancentre.com/en). It has been a while since we last visited there.

We went in to look for shodo brushes but came out with nattō.  My wife and I love nattō!

In terms of stocks and varieties, the Japan Centre is a great place for anything Japanese but it is far too packed and busy to browse. Next time I might try the online shop instead.

## Japanese Books

[JP Books](http://shop.jpbooks.co.uk/en/) is at a stone's throw from the Japan Centre.

It is one of my objectives for this year to read more Japanese books than I have done in the past couple of years.

I am now reading "[Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Colorless-Tsukuru-Tazaki-Years-Pilgrimage/dp/1846558336)" by [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami), which I bought at JP Books near Soho.
