We have missed [Colston Hall Record Fair](http://www.colstonhallrecordfair.co.uk/) three times already this year so we were glad to finally be able to take a look this weekend. It is the biggest record fair in the South West and definitely worth a visit!

As you walk into the building you will notice how airy and open [Colston Hall](http://www.colstonhall.org/) is.

It was pleasant and almost therapeutic to walk around the foyer watching and listening to people browsing and discussing records.

Thankfully (not for the traders of course) the fair was not as crowded as we anticipated. It was probably because we visited at 3pm (the event closes at 4pm) and also due to the bad weather.

Overall the event had a relaxing and calm atmosphere.

I know it probably sounds silly but there were such a LOT of records being sold spread over three floors. Although each box is well labelled with artist names or music genres, for us record fair beginners it was rather overwhelming. It must be vinyl heaven for the experienced enthusiast but we were not quite prepared this time.

The next record fair is on **5th November 2016** so be sure to check it out if you are in the area. We have already decided to give it another go. Perhaps next time we will decide what genre or artists to look for beforehand so that we do not feel quite so over-faced.

... and one final thing, there is a bar/kitchen on the lower ground floor in case you need a break. There is also [Beerd](http://www.beerdcolston.com/) higher up in the building should you fancy some craft beer and/or pizza.
