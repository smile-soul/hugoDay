Hello world!

I've recently been experimenting with [Hugo](//gohugo.io/), which is a static site generator created by [spf13](//github.com/spf13). My experience is still rudimentary but so far it's been fun using it. Hugo makes it really easy to setup, configure and customise a website.

A BIG thank you to spf13 for creating such a cool project!

As part of learning Hugo, I've had a go at creating a theme for it. It's called Blackburn and is available from [here](//github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn).

This serves as my first post.
