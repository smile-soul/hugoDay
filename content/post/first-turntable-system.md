I have been wanting to purchase a turntable system for quite some time. 2016 is our 10th year wedding anniversary and to mark the occasion, we have decided to buy our first turntable system.

### Ideal System

Being Japanese living in the UK, my ideal system would be made up of components made in the UK or Japan or by a UK or Japanese audio equipment manufacturer (without breaking the bank of course).

I am a beginner in the world of Hi-Fi equipment but have spent a few days doing research based on this criteria.

### Turntable

I quickly came across [Rega Research] (http://www.rega.co.uk/), which is based in the UK. I also found out about a Glasgow based company called [Linn Products] (http://www.linn.co.uk/) but I thought it best to save Linn for when I have bought my country manor house.

### Amplifier

I already had a few Japanese manufacturers in mind. While reading up on Rega turntables, [Onkyo](http://www.uk.onkyo.com/en/) caught my eye.

### Speakers

I have found choosing a pair of decent but affordable speakers the most difficult part of putting together a turntable system. Initially I ignored my criteria and settled on [DALI] (http://www.dali-speakers.com/), a Danish manufacturer.

### Audio T

Being beginners we wanted to speak to Hi-Fi experts from our local shop and buy there.

We paid our local Hi-Fi retailer, [Audio T](http://www.audiot.co.uk/) a visit. By speaking to a very knowledgeable sales person we learnt a number of things such as:

- It is a good idea to put a blob of blutack under the speakers if you are not using speaker stands
- The merits of different cable types
- There are strangly named components, for example banana plugs and speakers called squawkers
- The proper way to clean records

It would have been more difficult to find out about these things if we bought online.

### Finally

Here is a list of the components we have ordered:

- [Rega RP1 Turntable with Performance Pack](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rega-RP1-Turntable-Performance-Pack-Grey/dp/B0083I5BYQ)
- [Onkyo A9010 Amplifier](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Onkyo-A-9010-A9010-Amplifier-Black/dp/B00XPT9T7I/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1459155198&sr=1-1&keywords=onkyo+A9010)
- [Q Acoustics 3020 Bookshelf Speakers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acoustics-3020-Bookshelf-Speakers-Graphite/dp/B00TR7I1EY/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1459155228&sr=1-1&keywords=Q+Acoustics+3020)
- [Chord Company C-Screen Speaker Cable](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01A2JF2J2?psc=1)
- 8 BFA Z Plugs
- PRJ-BRUSHIT Carbon-Fibre Brush

The system is not ready yet so in the meantime we are going to buy some records.

It has been a fun bank holiday and it has been sunny for once!  I am looking forward to spending the next one listening to our first turntable system.
